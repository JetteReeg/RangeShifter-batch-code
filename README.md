[RangeShifter](https://rangeshifter.github.io/)
is an eco-evolutionary modelling platform that is becoming 
increasingly used worldwide for both theoretical and applied purposes
[(Bocedi et al. 2014)](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12162).

RangeShifter is a spatially-explicit, individual-based simulation platform that 
allows modelling speciesâ€™ population and range dynamics, such as expansion and shifting, and 
patch connectivity by linking complex local population dynamics and dispersal 
behaviour, while also taking into account inter-individual variability and 
evolutionary processes. RangeShifter is highly flexible in terms of the spatial 
resolution and extent, and regarding the complexity of the considered ecological 
processes. Due to its modular structure, the level of detail in genetics, demographic and 
dispersal processes can be easily adapted to different research questions and 
available data.
